        <h1>Shaping the Next Generation's Commute</h1>

        <h4>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h4>
        <p>In 12 short weeks I battled to empower Amazon’s return-to-office scheme by developing their employee
            carpooling service.
            Co-operation with an Agile team of developers allowed me to hand off a functional MVP to our team of
            clients. ~95 hours
            worth of brainstorming sessions, research, design and rapid prototyping were poured into reducing the cost
            of commuting,
            helping employees be more productive at work, and boosting employee morale.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Imagine trying to get your 1.56 million employees back into the office. Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Inc.,
                has
                pushed for a
                full return to in-person work after noticing advantages in a phased transition. While you might not be
                Andy
                Jassy, you
                surely can imagine the logistics this involves. It takes the form of the all-dreaded commute.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <h3>Commuting is an Overhead Cost</h3>
            <p>Amazon noticed its employees driving to work through the same congested areas along similar routes. At
                first
                glance, the
                traditional commute had pointed to various problems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating traffic bottlenecks at certain locations</li>
                <li>Contributing to air pollution</li>
                <li>Forcing employees to find parking</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But these issues were second to one that was hard to miss — driving proved to be mentally draining. The
                morning
                peak of
                mental alertness was wasted by employees in getting to the office. Productivity levels suffered when
                employees
                had
                already spent much of their focus on low ROI activities.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Kick-Off</h2>
            <h3>Heroes of our Story</h3>
            <p>Three innovative software developers based out of the Ireland HQ had brainstormed a solution to Amazon’s
                woes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Frances Humphreys — Software Development Manager</li>
                <li>Flavia Gheorghe — Sr. Software Development Engineer</li>
                <li>Paula Căciulescu — Software Development Engineer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With a vision in mind, the trio reached out to the SwEng Industry Projects program at my university —
                Trinity
                College
                Dublin. The initiative connects future engineers with companies to work together on real-life industry
                projects. These
                are proposed & mentored by select partners like Amazon. Having seen their project proposal, I was one of
                eight others to
                share their vision and act on it over the course of 12 weeks.</p>

            <h3>A Vision & Objective Worth Sharing</h3>
            <p>So, what was their vision?</p>
            <p>Frances, Flavia and Paula (our partnered clients) saw potential in a cross-platform mobile application
                enabling a
                carpooling-to-work initiative. Amazon employees would thus be able to search for and offer rides to the
                office
                together
                with other employees at the firm.</p>
            <p>The objective of this project encompassed the client being able to organize carpools with little effort
                through
                the app.
                In direct response to the identified problems, the project would:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Greatly reduce the cost of commuting</li>
                <li>Help employees be more productive at work</li>
                <li>Boost morale in a social environment outside of work</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Defining the Scope</h2>
            <h3>Rooting for Clarity</h3>
            <p>The team was assembled. The vision and objective were settled. But, what now? We had one big gap
                separating
                us
                from
                knowing what features to build or leave out. The team was missing concrete product requirements.</p>
            <p>Enter the Competitive Benchmark. Our first team meeting had me curious for initial impressions of how
                other
                carpooling
                services were approaching their software design. A weekend’s worth of work had me investigating two
                crucial
                aspects —
                the ride searching and ride posting features of comparable mobile apps.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="media/tapacar/compBenchmark.png" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of competitive benchmark">
                <figcaption>Three carpooling apps were scrutinized from the home page down to the ride confirmation —
                    using
                    a
                    set of heuristic
                    techniques to appraise their UI & UX</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>The Discovery</h3>
            <p>The level of qualitative insights we got answered many unknowns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How do competitors solve the problem?</li>
                <li>What established design & feature conventions must we copy?</li>
                <li>What practices should we emulate?</li>
                <li>What practices should we avoid?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Setting Product Requirements</h3>
            <p>In no time I got the team brainstorming on wider spans. After a quick debrief on the Competitive
                Benchmark,
                the
                team &
                clients were ready to sit down and collectively agree on the product requirements.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>All Hands on Deck</h2>
            <h3>Thinking of the Users</h3>
            <p>You need time for people to agree on something. We were already into Week 3 (out of 12) by the time the
                product
                requirements list was given the stamp of approval. And we had just 8 days to put together something
                tangible
                for
                our 1st
                Sprint Review.</p>
            <figure>
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img class="img-duo-1" src="media/tapacar/clientMeeting.jpg" loading="lazy"
                        alt="Photo of team at client meeting">
                    <img class="img-duo-2" src="media/tapacar/clientMeeting2.jpg" loading="lazy"
                        alt="Photo of teammate writing on whiteboard">
                </div>
                <figcaption>Settling on the product requirements with our clients</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now, I tend to follow the UX process quite religiously. I’m a big believer in good research generating
                great
                products.
                For this reason, I wanted to push for more data — by conducting usability tests on carpooling apps I
                benchmarked. Did
                these apps match the mental models of users?</p>
            <p>I had little time to answer that question. The team leader wanted me to move from research into design
                mode.
            </p>
            <p>So I asked myself — “why not use the apps I benchmarked to influence our design decisions?” Given their
                longstanding
                availability and considerable user base, I hypothesized that they already underwent extensive user
                trials &
                feedback.
                Their information architecture (IA) must hence match the user’s mental models with a high level of
                confidence.
            </p>

            <h3>Creating the Scaffolding</h3>
            <p>There was one question on everyone’s minds: “How do we structure the app? Where do we even begin?”
                Inspired
                by
                the apps
                we benchmarked, I began mapping our own IA.</p>
            <p>A User Flow diagram was the solution. At a high level, it proved practical in laying out various
                interactions
                &
                screen
                states. From the moment the user created an account, down to their ride confirmation. The combination
                would
                dictate what
                the user encounters & when during their navigation.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="media/tapacar/userFlow.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of user flow diagram">
                <figcaption>Every interaction & screen state was mapped out to give essential structure to our app
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>At a lower level, however, I wanted to break down the most common problem in stages. What was the user’s
                goal
                at
                each
                stage of our app? That’s why I split the app navigation into “sub-flows”.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="media/tapacar/subflow.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of sub-flow in user flow diagram">
                <figcaption>This instance of a sub-flow focused on the passenger’s concern for selecting their ride to
                    the
                    office</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>By Week 4, a completed user flow had constructed the IA — bringing us closer to the first interface
                designs
                of
                our app.</p>
            <h3>Iterating App Designs</h3>
            <p>Sketching was the way to go for rapid ideation over app designs. I often partnered with our frontend
                developer to
                incorporate frequent feedback into drafted designs for screens. It helped us avoid components debated as
                “too
                difficult”
                to implement down the line.</p>
            <p>Incremental changes were also less likely to be disputed. We achieved quick agreement over design ideas —
                proving
                the
                power of working in an Agile environment. I delivered the sketches and my partner developed the screens
                in
                React.js.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Our dynamic held strong from Week 5 until almost the end of the project. I also found myself coding too!
                To
                meet
                tight
                deadlines while building frontend intuition, I took over smaller tasks I knew I could deliver.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>A Respectable Finish</h2>
            <h3>Finalizing the Prototype</h3>
            <p>For many weeks we had a steady stream of code pushing the native prototype to completion. It was by Week
                10
                when
                things
                started getting heated…</p>
            <p>Our app worked. It was functional. It met a lot of criteria on the product requirements list. Except for
                one
                —
                “the
                users to find this experience as smooth as possible”. There was nothing smooth about the inconsistency
                of
                our UI
                design.
                As a consequence of rapid prototyping, we favoured functionality over user perception.</p>
            <p>It was for THE COMMUTERS that we were building this app. We couldn’t deliver a confusing-looking product
                that
                would add
                to their mental exhaustion. The team would be solving one less problem motivating this project.</p>

            <h3>Adding Some Flair</h3>
            <p>I took it upon myself to deliver a well-rounded interface with just 2 weeks to go. It was time to
                leverage a
                design
                system.</p>
            <p>I drew substantial inspiration from Google’s Material Design 3. Put together by their powerhouse of
                designers, I
                was in
                safe hands by covering 80% of Tapacar’s use cases with their readily-designed UI components. Of the
                tweaks I
                made were
                app-specific redesigns to components & adaptations to color tokens to match Tapacar’s branding.</p>
            <figure>

                        alt="Photo of components designed for the app">
                </picture>
                <figcaption>Google’s Material 3 components had been adapted to match Tapacar’s use case & branding —
                    while
                    being
                    mindful of the
                    contexts they’re presented in & how they respond to interactions</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Had I designed a UI from scratch, the app would’ve never materialized its visual potential. It takes too
                much
                time to figure out spacing, typography, colors in a unified context by yourself.</p>

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>Wow, are you still reading?! You must be hooked to see the final result. I have something that won’t
                disappoint…

            <p>Talk about a carpooling app now! Presenting Tapacar — the next generation of mobility to the office. Our
                MVP
                has
                the
                required capabilities you need to enjoy a pleasant commute:</p>

            <h4>SEARCH A RIDE</h4>
            <p>Passengers (i.e. employees in need of a lift) are able to search a ride by logging their destination and
                the
                date
                & time
                to leave at. They also input the number of seats to book for that ride. Results of rides offered by
                drivers
                are
                then
                presented. The user picks one and requests the driver’s confirmation before the booking is settled.</p>
            <h4>PUBLISH A RIDE</h4>
            <p>Drivers (i.e. employees looking to provide lifts) can offer a ride by logging their departure point,
                destination
                and
                time they will leave at. They also input the number of seats available for that ride. These parameters
                are
                used
                to
                publish their availability for offering a ride to others. This ride will be presented to any passengers
                searching for
                rides with similar parameters.</p>
            <h4>PASSENGER-DRIVER INTERACTIONS</h4>
            <p>Drivers have a say over what passengers to pick up. Each passenger must wait for the driver’s
                confirmation
                before
                they
                avail of the ride.</p>
            <h4>ECO REPORT</h4>
            <p>Drivers & passengers have a summary page outlining their energy/pollution savings as a result of
                carpooling
                activity. It
                acts as a tangible method for users to understand their impact on the environment.</p>

            <h2>Resolution</h2>
            <h3>Making an Impact</h3>
            <p>The whole project behind Tapacar was motivated by three problems related to traditional commutes. How
                well
                does
                our
                solution target them? Let’s take another look with a fresh perspective:</p>

            <h4>KEY PROBLEM</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Before: Employees arriving at the office mentally drained from a draining commute.</li>
                <li>After: Employees now improve morale in a social environment outside of work when they socialize with
                    fellow
                    employees on
                    their commute.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>SUB-PROBLEM #1</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Before: Creating traffic bottlenecks at certain locations.</li>
                <li>After: <strong>Searching & publishing</strong> rides reduces cars on the roads & boosts vehicle
                    occupancy
                    rates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>SUB-PROBLEM #2</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Before: Contributing to air pollution.</li>
                <li>After: <strong>Eco reports</strong> incentivize commuters to avail of environmentally friendly
                    methods
                    of
                    commuting, e.g. carpooling.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>SUB-PROBLEM #3</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Before: Forcing employees to find parking.</li>
                <li>After: Employee car parks notice higher capacity in light of higher vehicle occupancy rates across
                    the
                    company.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>With these checkboxes ticked, our clients were delighted to see a well-grounded project that was handed
                off
                on
                the right
                tone.</p>

            <h3>What's Next</h3>
            <p>Twelve weeks offered us the opportunity to bootstrap a respectable MVP. However, we cut a lot of corners
                to
                meet
                tight
                deadlines. For one, we were left with no time to test our shiny digital prototype with our target
                audience.
                Let
                alone
                code it natively after a successful testing run.</p>
            <p>As such, a usability testing would be long due. User feedback would need to be incorporated before the
                app
                rolls
                out and
                receives additional features.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>Any project will have its setbacks, chaos and unpredictability. It’s the nature of the game. And we
                de-risked
                it
                as much
                as possible by following Agile principles backed by frequent Scrum meetings.</p>
            <p>I’ve picked up valuable lessons on staying agile in a tight timeframe. If you want to win at the game,
                you
                must
                plan &
                research before anyone else. A finished Competitive Benchmark, for instance, should’ve been presented at
                the
                first team
                meeting. That’s a week’s time gained right there. Think you can do something else in that period?
                Conduct a
                usability
                test on competitors’ apps and leverage more insights to drive the design of a better-tailored solution.
                That
                eliminates
                a lot of unknowns, especially if Tapacar were to actually hit the markets. I would not let a real life
                product
                go
                without a testing session.</p>
