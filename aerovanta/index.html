        <h1>Consolidating Experiences for Today's Holidaymakers</h1>

        <h4>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h4>
        <p>Booking your flights for a holiday is a complex process, with a clear-cut way of doing things that bears
            little room for
            error. I fulfilled the practical component of my Professional Diploma in UX Design by circumventing the
            myopia of
            today’s large airliner websites. The full design cycle — research, design, analysis and prototyping — was
            pursued to
            match the goals and behaviours of the modern holidaymaker.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Hey, can you feel that? You got a fuzzy feeling in your soul. One full of freedom and rebellious optimism
                kickstarting
                your appetite for escapades.</p>
            <p>Can you picture it? You’re sitting pool-side with a margarita in one hand. A sunset completes your view
                while you relax
                after an adventurous trek in a place you barely know.</p>
            <p>Snap back to reality for a second. You’re going on holiday and you can hardly wait. Look at you! “Hotel,
                check.
                Sightseeing reservations, check.” At this point you’re running a mental checklist on the daily.</p>
            <p>“Oh no…I totally forgot about the flights.” People nowadays are used to dealing with transport
                arrangements without a
                hand from travel agents. They don’t mind juggling several plans into a meaningful trip by themselves.
                Lucky for them,
                the websites of airlines today provide the flexibility and convenience of an agent for less than their
                regular
                commission.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>Airlines still want an extra buck. Monetization efforts on their part have cluttered the core of their
                service offerings
                with partnered add-ons and benefits. That leaves users overwhelmed. They lack the headroom and patience
                to deal with
                confusing websites in their holiday arrangements.</p>
            <p>With that perspective, I'm taking you on an adventure to investigate where today's big airlines are
                falling short in the
                customer journey. You'll get to see how I utilized the complete design process to strengthen the user
                experience (UX)
                while maintaining their business case.</p>

            <h2>A Typical 9 Step Journey</h2>
            <p>Back to your frantic search for flights:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You have your destination and date range in mind, but you find yourself clueless regarding the
                    airlines that can take
                    you there and back. This moment has you rushing to the likes of Skyscanner. Flight aggregators are
                    your best friend when
                    searching all possible flight combinations between two locations.</li>
                <li>Research on Skyscanner quickly culminates once you pick a flight that suits you. However, rumour has
                    it that aggregators
                    charge its own commissions on bookings. You switch websites, navigating to your airline’s
                    counterpart. It’s a small
                    hassle you think will save you money.</li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="quote">Sometimes I hate when you go onto Aer Lingus but flights [are shown] through
                        something else.</p>
                    <cite class="citation">— user commenting on results, promoted by search engines, that create
                        friction
                        when browsing for
                        their aggregators and/or
                        airline websites</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <li>You arrive on the landing page and are ready to search. Nothing to bug you now, except the premature
                    offerings of car
                    rentals & accommodation add-ons.</li>
                <li>Aha! You’ve spotted where to put your flight criteria. Meanwhile, you recall the departure & arrival
                    locations of the
                    flight you’ve previously settled on. It’s a positive experience at this stage. Bonus points when the
                    website offers
                    shortcuts to speed up your search.</li>
                <li>Picking your holiday time period is just as easy. Your intuition takes over the moment you see a
                    familiar date picker
                    pop up to save you the typing.</li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="quote">I like to see the calendar clearly for me, it’s very similar to my MacBook, the way
                        I can have
                        the calendar set up that
                        I can see the whole month.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <li>You finish inputting your criteria by selecting the number of people flying with you. Light work so
                    far.</li>
                <li>And your positive experience slowly peaks at the stage of comparing the flight results shown on
                    screen. You’re looking
                    for the flight that matches the one you saw on Skyscanner. It takes a few minutes, but it’s not too
                    burdening. Orderly
                    presentation of varied data points at a glance keep your momentum going. You select the flight that
                    matches your needs.</li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="quote">I didn’t have to click into it to look for the price.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <li>That momentum immediately goes downhill. By now you look at your flight’s travel classes in
                    desperation. Wading through
                    their different perks and price points, you slowly arrive at a decision regarding the best value for
                    money. You might
                    compare a few times between flights, which is not easy. Nothing points clearly how to trace back a
                    few steps or keep
                    going with your booking.</li>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="quote">Why don’t I have that as an option? If it’s not an option, why tell me that I can’t
                        have it if
                        it’s not there.</p>

                <li><i>Phew.</i> You made it through that jungle! The horizon lights up as you advance to the last
                    stages of the booking process. A
                    neat reminder illustrates the flight selections you made right before payment. Are you happy with
                    your picks? You’re
                    free to pay using your payment method of choice.</li>

            <h2>Behind the Journey</h2>
            <p>What you just read puts into view the typical customer journey. The average user faces an experience
                along those lines. Extensive research across several sources backs it up.</p>
            <p>My research initially started with a Competitive Benchmark. From the onset of the project I had been
                curious of one
                thing specifically — how other transatlantic airlines approach the design of their websites. A thorough
                investigation of
                four airlines helped me identify established design conventions. Not to mention examples of best and
                lacking practice
                too.</p>

                <figcaption>Four airline websites were investigated from the landing page down to the booking review —
                    using a set of heuristic
                    techniques to appraise their UI & UX</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Although secondary research can only take you so far. I was keen to contextualize my findings through
                real interactions
                with target users. That opportunity came through a Depth Interview paired with a Usability Test. In one
                week I set up,
                moderated, and recorded a session for the sake of collecting richer insights about existing websites.
            </p>
            <p>To top it all off, I had access to two additional recordings of separate test sessions. They were kindly
                provided to me
                by the UX Design Institute — while undertaking this project as part of my Professional Diploma in UX
                Design.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Framing & Solving the Problem</h2>
            <p>A lot of research for a lot of insights. I drew affinity from 241 different research points to empathize
                with the user &
                further motivate this project.</p>
            <p>I then asked myself, “What would it look like if I took all of the low points in this journey and
                elevated them?”</p>
            <img src="media/emotionJourneyAfter.png" loading="lazy"
                alt="Customer journey depicted by emotions after elevating low points">
            <p>This process enabled me to step back, see the big picture, and identify potential areas for growth and
                improvement.</p>

            <h3>Keeping Within Conventional Bounds</h3>
            <p>All airline websites follow conventions to a degree. For good reason too — users know what to expect when
                embarking on a
                booking journey. I wanted to fit within the existing mental models to leverage that sense of
                familiarity.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>This was instilled across all levels: from the bare bones of the IA down to the more embellished designs
                of screens &
                interactions.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Minimizing the Obstrusive</h3>
            <p>Know the rules well enough, and you can break them. Even these conventions offer wiggle room for
                consolidating UX in the
                context of airline websites.</p>
            <p>I was shocked to see today’s websites clutter the users’ minds from the get-go. The landing page welcomed
                them with too
                many calls-to-action and promotional offers conflicting for the user’s attention. By Hick’s Law, the
                time it takes to
                make a decision increases with the number & complexity of choices. You don’t want the user to wait
                before getting into
                the booking flow — they haven’t invested time nor effort, so you may lose them entirely at this stage.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Promotional hero banners must be complementary, not conflicting, with the search input
                    fields. Controls must be visible
                    for the user to purse their goals in the present context</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>I pushed my minimalist philosophy towards the design of the menu components too. Research showed how
                users frequently
                interact with several instances. It was a recurring element within the typical journey. I hence felt
                obliged to optimize
                it — for the sake of retaining user’s attention on the flow.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="media/fullMenu.png" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of fullscreen menu in the prototype">
                <figcaption>Full screen menus are components with rich functionality that require the user’s unwavering
                    attention. We cannot afford
                    to lose the user’s attention to anything outside of the presented context. Their blurry background
                    covers the viewport
                    to warrant a higher degree of focus on the goal at hand — i.e. picking dates for flights.

                    to make much sense of how these work. A reduced cognitive load means we can afford the user juggling
                    their attention
                    between different contexts with a goal in mind — i.e. providing passenger identification.

            <h3>Promoting Flexibility</h3>
            <p>The real space for innovation came in the form of flexibility. Too many airlines have false faith in a
                user who knows
                what is doing & is certain of their actions. Their hypothesis translates into rigid websites that punish
                user mistakes
                through time or money.</p>
            <p>Micro-conversions are sprinkled along the path to booking your flight. That's precisely where the big
                airlines don't strike too well in the Customer Journey.</p>
            <p>Take the uncertainty of searching flights. A user can revise their flight of choice several times before
                making their
                final decision. In this time frame, they may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Leave the website</li>
                <li>Think it through the following day</li>
                <li>Revisit the booking the following day</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Catering to such non-linear journey involves a certain level of flexibility being passed to the user.
                That makes the
                difference between a generalized service and one that caters to individual needs.</p>

            <!-- TODO: INSERT PHOTO OF PROTOTYPE SHOWCASE -->

            <p>Baggage is another exemplary hot topic. And it’s a significant micro-conversion — getting the user set
                for purchasing
                their flight tickets. Users often don’t have a choice in the booking journey regarding their allowances,
                often being
                delayed till check-in time. That leaves room for human error, doesn’t it? Why not permit the
                well-prepared to handle
                their baggage allowances at booking?</p>

            <h2>Finish</h2>
            <p>Those are some noteworthy changes I made to elevate the customer journey. Just like you saw, I had taken
                my sketches of
                screens & interactions and brought them to life through an interactive prototype for desktop. Building
                it at a medium
                fidelity had placed my focus on nailing the flow, screen layouts, copy and key interactions.</p>

            <h3>Ending the Project</h3>
            <p>This would’ve been a good stage in the cycle to test the prototype with real users — especially if I was
                dealing with a
                real-life product. Having tried my hand at user testing earlier in the project, I skipped it in favour
                of a deliverable
                that would teach me something different for my UX diploma.</p>

                    work</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Annotating the prototype essentially ticked off the project as complete. Extensive effort across
                research, analysis,
                design and prototyping had completed the entire design cycle. That makes the product ready to be handed
                off to
                developers for building it.</p>

            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <p>The project around Aerovanta came with lessons aplenty.</p>
            <p>A big learning curve was experienced in the research stage. It was my first time learning how strategic
                you need to be
                to pick up valid data while keeping the interviewee unbiased. I picked up the art of asking the right
                customer questions
                in research.</p>
            <p>The analysis stage came with its own learnings too. The data collected couldn’t go without some wrangling
                to derive
                insights. Through application I saw what it takes to analyse large volumes of unorganized qualitative
                data.</p>
            <p>In another sense, this project marked the practical aspect of my Professional Diploma in UX Design. It
                took many months
                to dredge through the design cycle — I took the project at a slower pace to incorporate many learnings
                from my course
                lessons.</p>
